# 1. George is planning his breakfast for the week.

He has utility function:
$$U(Q_A, Q_T) = Q_A^{1/2} Q_T^{1/2}$$
where $Q_A$ is the quantity of avocados and $Q_T$ is the quantity of toast. The price of avocados is $P_A$, the price of toast is $P_T$, and George has a budget of $M$ to spend on breakfast.

## (a) Solve for the tangency condition.

Considering the marginal utilities:
  
$$MU_A = \frac{1}{2}Q_A^{-1/2}$$
$$MU_A = \frac{1}{2}Q_T^{-1/2}$$

$$\frac{Q_T^{-1/2}}{Q_A^{-1/2}} = \frac{P_A}{P_T}$$

## (b) What is the demand function for avocados? What is the demand function for toast?

Considering the tangency condition:
$$Q_T = Q_A \left(\frac{P_A}{P_T}\right)^2$$
Substituting into the budget constraint:

$$M = P_A Q_A + P_T \left[ Q_A \left(\frac{P_A}{P_T}\right)^2 \right]$$

$$M = P_A Q_A + \frac{P_A^2}{P_T} Q_A$$

$$M = Q_A P_A \left(1 + \frac{P_A}{P_T}\right)$$

Thus, the demand function for avocados is:

$$Q_A = \frac{M}{P_A \left(1 + \frac{P_A}{P_T}\right)}$$

Substituting back to find the demand function for toast:

$$Q_T = \frac{M}{P_T \left(1 + \frac{P_T}{P_A}\right)}$$


## (c) (5 points) Are avocados normal goods? Justify your answer by mathematical derivation.

# 2. Chloe makes $500 per week and spends all her income on books and tea. Books cost $25 each, and Chloe buys 16 each week. Tea costs $5 per cup, and Chloe buys 20 cups. When Chloe’s income falls to $450 per week, she cuts her consumption of books by 3 books and purchases 5 more cups of tea. Find the income elasticity of the demand for books; are books normal goods or inferior good for Chloe? Find the income elasticity of the demand for tea; is tea a normal good or an inferior good for Chloe?

The income elasticity of the demand for books is:

$$E_B = \frac{\Delta Q_B}{\Delta M} \cdot \frac{M_{initial}}{Q_{B initial}} = \frac{-3}{-50} \cdot \frac{500}{16} = 1.875$$
Considering the income elasticity of demand for books is positive, books are normal goods for Chloe.

The income elasticity of the demand for tea is:

$$E_T = \frac{\Delta Q_T}{\Delta M} \cdot \frac{M_{initial}}{Q_{T initial}} = \frac{5}{-50} \cdot \frac{500}{20} = -2.5$$
Since the income elasticity of demand for tea is negative, tea is an inferior good for Chloe.



# 3. You are the alderman for the 20th ward of Chicago. In your ward, there are vacant lots that you are in charge of selling. Currently, the city sells a full lot for $150,000. Buyers can purchase a little or a much of a lot as the wish. For example, if someone buys half of a lot, they would pay $75,000.

Utility: 

$$U(Q_R,Q_G) = 500,000Q_R - 250,000Q_R^2 + 2Q_G$$

## (a) Solve for a buyer’s demand for real estate and demand for all other goods. 

Considering budget, $Q_G$ in terms of $Q_R$:
$$Q_G = M - P_RQ_R$$

Substituting into utility function:
$$U(Q_R) = 500,000Q_R - 250,000Q_R^2 + 2(M - P_RQ_R)$$

Taking the derivative with respect to $Q_R$ and setting to zero:
$$\frac{dU}{dQ_R} = 500,000 - 500,000Q_R - 2P_R = 0$$

Solving for $Q_R$:
$$Q_R = 1 - \frac{2P_R}{500,000}$$
Substituting back to find $Q_G$:

$$Q_G = M - P_R \left(1 - \frac{2P_R}{500,000}\right) = M - P_R + \frac{2P_R^2}{500,000}$$


## (b) When the city is selling land for $150,000 per lot, how much real estate does each buyer purchase? How about all other goods?

Substituting $P_R = 150,000$ into the demand functions:
$$Q_R = 1 - \frac{2(150,000)}{500,000} = 0.4$$
$$Q_G = M - 150,000 + \frac{2(150,000)^2}{500,000} = M - 150,000 + 90,000 = M - 60,000$$

## (c) With the upcoming opening of the Obama Foundation headquarters, the city is going to raise the price of real estate to $200,000. Now how much real estate and other goods will each buyer purchase?

Substituting $P_R = 200,000$ into the demand functions:
$$Q_R = 1 - \frac{2(200,000)}{500,000} = 0.2$$
$$Q_G = M - 200,000 + \frac{2(200,000)^2}{500,000} = M - 200,000 + 160,000 = M - 40,000$$

## (d) Using the Lasperyres approach, find out how much residents’ incomes would have to rise in order to ensure they can afford their old bundle.

The original bundle consists of $Q_R = 0.4$ and $Q_G = M - 60,000$. So the cost at the new prices is:
$$Cost = P_R \cdot Q_R + Q_G = 200,000 \cdot 0.4 + (M - 60,000) = 80,000 + M - 60,000 = M + 20,000$$
## (e) Given a choice between the compensated income and new prices you discovered in 3d and a return to old prices, what would consumers prefer?
