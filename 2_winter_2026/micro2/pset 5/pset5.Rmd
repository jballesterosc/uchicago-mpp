# Part II

## Question 1

**Consider the following simplified duopoly game. Each firm simultaneously chooses whether to Cooperate or Defect. Payoffs are shown in the table below, and given as $(\pi_1, \pi_2)$:**

|           | Cooperate     | Defect        |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Cooperate | $(100, 100)$  | $(0, 150)$    |
| Defect    | $(150, 0)$    | $(X, X)$      |

**Suppose the firms interact infinitely many times, with common discount factor $\delta \in (0, 1)$. They attempt to sustain cooperation using a grim trigger strategy: both firms cooperate unless a defection occurs, in which case both defect forever after.**

### (a) (5 points)

**What is the present value of cooperating in each time period, assuming that the other firm will also cooperate in each time period?**

If both firms cooperate in each period, each firm earns the $\pi = 100$ per period. The present value is for this scenario is:

$$PV_C = \frac{100}{1 - \delta}$$

### (b)

**What is the present value of defecting today, assuming that the other firm will cooperate today, but defect in each time period in the future?**

If a firm defects today while the other cooperates, it earns 150. Under grim trigger, both firms then defect forever, earning 

$$PV_D = 150 + \frac{\delta X}{1 - \delta}$$

### (c) 

**Suppose $X = 0$. For what values of $\delta$ can cooperation be sustained?**

Cooperation is sustainable under grim trigger if $PV_C \geq PV_D$. With $X=0$, 

$$\frac{100}{1 - \delta} \geq 150$$

Solving $100 \geq 150(1 - \delta)$, we get $\delta \geq \frac{1}{3}$

Therefore, cooperation can be sustained for $\delta \geq \frac{1}{3}$.

### (d)

**Suppose $X = 50$. For what values of $\delta$ can cooperation be sustained?**

Cooperation is sustainable if $PV_C \geq PV_D$. With $X = 50$:

$$\frac{100}{1 - \delta} \geq 150 + \frac{50\delta}{1 - \delta}$$

Multiplying by $(1 - \delta)$: $100 \geq 150(1 - \delta) + 50\delta$, we get $\delta \geq \frac{1}{2}$

Cooperation can be sustained for $\delta \geq \frac{1}{2}$.

### (e) 

**Consider your answer to the previous two questions. Does a higher $X$ make cooperation more likely or less likely? Provide a concise explanation.**

A higher $X$ makes cooperation less likely. When $X = 0$, cooperation requires $\delta \geq \frac{1}{3}$. When $X = 50$, cooperation requires $\delta \geq \frac{1}{2}$.

In this case, $X$ represents the punishment payoff from mutual defection. A higher $X$ translates to a less severe punishment, reducing the incentive to cooperate, as the cost of defection is lower.
