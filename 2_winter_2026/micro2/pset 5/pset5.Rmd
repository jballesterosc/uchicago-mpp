# Part II: Problems

## Question 1 (25 points)

Consider the following simplified duopoly game. Each firm simultaneously chooses whether to Cooperate or Defect. Payoffs are shown in the table below, and given as $(\pi_1, \pi_2)$:

|           | Cooperate     | Defect        |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Cooperate | $(100, 100)$  | $(0, 150)$    |
| Defect    | $(150, 0)$    | $(X, X)$      |

Suppose the firms interact infinitely many times, with common discount factor $\delta \in (0, 1)$. They attempt to sustain cooperation using a grim trigger strategy: both firms cooperate unless a defection occurs, in which case both defect forever after.

### (a) (5 points)

What is the present value of cooperating in each time period, assuming that the other firm will also cooperate in each time period? *(Hint: your answer will be a function of $\delta$ and $X$)*

**Answer:**




### (b) (5 points)

What is the present value of defecting today, assuming that the other firm will cooperate today, but defect in each time period in the future? *(Hint: your answer will be a function of $\delta$ and $X$)*

**Answer:**




### (c) (5 points)

Suppose $X = 0$. For what values of $\delta$ can cooperation be sustained?

**Answer:**




### (d) (5 points)

Suppose $X = 50$. For what values of $\delta$ can cooperation be sustained?

**Answer:**




### (e) (5 points)

Consider your answer to the previous two questions. Does a higher $X$ make cooperation more likely or less likely? Provide a concise explanation.

**Answer:**
