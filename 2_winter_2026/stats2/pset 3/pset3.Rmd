# 1. The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, Revisited (16 points)

**For this assignment, you can refer to any output that comes from the `lm()` function in R.**

## Q1 

**In Problem Set #1, we found that one of the baseline characteristics, `numhh_list`, was statistically significant from zero at the 5 percent level. Oh no, did randomization fail? It turns out that the researchers expected this. The reason this happened is because treatment was assigned at the household level, and households with more eligible individuals had more chances to win the lottery. Fortunately, we can easily deal with this violation of balance using multivariate regression techniques!**

**The regression controlling for family size is given as follows:**

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Treated + \beta_2 numhh\_list + u$$

**Recall in problem set #1, you ran the following regression:**

$$Y = \beta'_0 + \beta'_1 Treated + v$$

**For each of the five outcomes, calculate the bias from not including `numhh_list` as a control, filling in the table below. Are any of these biases quantitatively large enough to fundamentally change any of your qualitative conclusions about the OHIE?**

### Q1. Answer

| Outcome | Bias |
|---------|------|
| count_visit_dr | -0.1978184  |
| count_visit_er | -0.03814492  |
| out_of_pocket_spend | -5.841552 |
| health_score |-0.00206248 |
| happy | 0.007311952 |

In the four out of five outcomes. (`count_visit_dr`,`count_visit_er`, `health_score`, `out_of_pocket_spend`), the bias from not including `numhh_list` is negative, therefore underestimated the true effect of the treatment. In the case of `happy`, the bias is positive, therefore overestimated the true effect of the treatment. 

The main take-away of the results, is than in four outcomes, the bias was close to 0, so no significant cause of concern. Nonetheless, the `out_of_pocket_spend` is the only outcome that has a bias that is large enough to change the conclusions about this indicator, as the bias is around -5.84, which is significant. This means that not controlling for `numhh_list` would have led us to underestimate the true effect of the treatment on out-of-pocket spending by a significant amount.

### Q1. Code

```{r q1-visitdr, include=TRUE}
true_model <- lm(count_visit_dr ~ treated + numhh_list, data=df, na.action = na.omit)
under_model <- lm(count_visit_dr ~ treated, data=df, na.action = na.omit)

bias <- coef(under_model)["treated"] - coef(true_model)["treated"]
bias
```
```{r q1-visiter, include=TRUE}
true_model <- lm(count_visit_er ~ treated + numhh_list, data=df, na.action = na.omit)
under_model <- lm(count_visit_er ~ treated, data=df, na.action = na.omit)

bias <- coef(under_model)["treated"] - coef(true_model)["treated"]
bias
```

```{r q1-outof, include=TRUE}
true_model <- lm(out_of_pocket_spend ~ treated + numhh_list, data=df, na.action = na.omit)
under_model <- lm(out_of_pocket_spend ~ treated, data=df, na.action = na.omit)

bias <- coef(under_model)["treated"] - coef(true_model)["treated"]
bias
```

bias
```

```{r q1-happy, include=TRUE}
true_model <- lm(happy ~ treated + numhh_list, data=df, na.action = na.omit)
under_model <- lm(happy ~ treated, data=df, na.action = na.omit)

bias <- coef(under_model)["treated"] - coef(true_model)["treated"]
bias

## Q2

**Let's look at which groups increased their doctor office visits the most in response to the treatment. Fill in the table below by running separate regressions of `visit_dr` on `treated`, and controlling for `numhh_list`, i.e. by running model (1) above, for each of the groups listed in the table.**

**Discuss your findings: which group has the largest estimated treatment effects, which group has the smallest? Be sure to also consider the statistical significance.**

### Q2. Answer

| Group | $\hat{\beta}_1$ | S.E.$(\hat{\beta}_1)$ |
|-------|-----------------|----------------------|
| female==0 | 0.3420393 | 0.2836245 |
| female==1 | 0.7926379 | 0.3118582 |
| age<50 | 0.6440451 | 0.2588436 |
| age>50 | 0.4097361 | 0.3933661 |
| race_white==0 | 0.1638626 | 0.3303053 |
| race_white==1 | 0.8066601 | 0.2760115 |
| health_baseline==0 | 0.6450163 | 0.2393665 |
| health_baseline==1 | 0.4180334 | 0.4681090 |

## Question 3 (3 points)

**Returning to the full data and still focusing on the number of doctor office visits, let's also try controlling for education.**

**Using information in the variables `hs_degree` and `college_degree`, create a new indicator variable if someone DOES NOT have a high-school degree, call this new variable `NO_hs_degree`.**

**Try running each of the following regressions. Discuss how your estimated treatment effect, the precision of this estimate (standard error), and $R^2$ changes from just including `numhh_list`, i.e. model (1) above. If you cannot estimate a coefficient, explain why.**

$$count\_visit\_dr = \beta_0 + \beta_1 treated + \beta_2 numhh\_list + \beta_3 hs\_degree + \beta_4 college\_degree + u \quad (3)$$

$$count\_visit\_dr = \beta'_0 + \beta'_1 treated + \beta'_2 numhh\_list + \beta'_3 NO\_hs\_degree + \beta_4 hs\_degree + \beta_5 college\_degree + u' \quad (4)$$

```{r q3}
# Your code here

```

## Question 4 (2 points)

**Now, let's try including all the baseline characteristics as controls to the regression. Rerun the regression of `count_visit_dr` on `treated`, and control for:**

- `numhh_list`
- `female`
- `age`
- `race_white`
- `hs_degree`
- `college_degree`
- `health_baseline`

**How does your estimated treatment effect, the precision of this estimate (standard error), and $R^2$ change from the model just including `numhh_list`?**

## Question 5 (1 point)

**Do you think we should include all these other baseline characteristics as controls to ensure that the treatment effects are unbiased, or is it sufficient to just control for `numhh_list`? Explain.**

## Question 7 (3 points)

**Using the model with the full set of controls estimated in Question 4, conduct a hypothesis test that the treatment effect on the number of doctor office visits is equal to the effect of having a high school degree.**

**Note: In class, we discussed two different ways to conduct this test. You can choose either method.**

**To receive full credit, you should code this test manually in the manner we discussed in class and not use the `anova()` function or other such functions to perform hypothesis testing.**
